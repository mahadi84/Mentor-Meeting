Title: ABCD of Fintech.

Fintech(Financial Technology): Use of technology to automate and improve financial services.

A: API, AI
B: Blockchain
C: Cloud Computing
D: Data Analytics

### A: API(Application Programming Interface) ###

     		Real-Time(Transaction):
			“software applications to talk to each other and exchange information securely”
			-Process a payment
            -Balance Check(Enough Balance?)
            -Balance Update(Debit/Credit money)
    
     - It's like a waiter taking your order to the kitchen and bringing back your food.
    - Behind the scenes, the restaurant's app is talking to your bank's app to make sure you have enough money and process the payment. 
 
### A: Artificial Intelligence (AI) ###
- build machines that can think and act like humans
- or even surpass human capabilities in certain areas Ex: PBL health
	  Personalized credit card/Loan/DPS offers: based on spending patterns/customer transactions.
  Algorithmic trading platforms: Automating stock trading based on market analysis.
        Chatbots: Providing instant customer support on banking apps.   
        Robo-advisors: Offering automated investment advice.   
        Fraud detection systems: Identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions.   
        

### B: Blockchain  ###
        Real-World Example:
            -Blockchain technology for cross-border payments, reducing transaction time and costs. 
            -Blockchain to create digital assets, such as digital bonds or tokens, and facilitate secure trading.

### C: Cloud Computing  ###
      Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive. 
      Think of it like renting space in a massive, secure data center instead of owning and maintaining your own server room.

	Benefits of Cloud Computing in FinTech
Cost-effectiveness: Reduce IT infrastructure costs and pay only for the resources used. 
Security: Enhanced security measures protect against cyber threats and data breaches.
      Accessibility: Access financial services anytime, anywhere, from any device.   
      Scalability: Easily adjust resources to handle peak demand or business growth.   
### D: Data Analytics  ###
      -Data analytics is like detective work for businesses: 
       to uncover hidden clues, patterns, and trends.
       to meet customer needs and make informed business decisions about products and services
       to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and risk factors.


         What Data Analytics Does:
            Gathers data:  Fintech companies collect tons of data – everything from your transaction history and account balances to your online behavior and social media activity.
            Cleans and organizes it:  Raw data is messy! Data analytics tools tidy it up and organize it so it can be analyzed.
            Finds patterns and insights:  Using clever algorithms and statistical techniques, data analytics reveals hidden patterns and trends within the data.
            Presents findings:  These insights are then visualized in charts, graphs, and reports that are easy to understand.

     Big Data Technologies:
            Hadoop: A framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
            Spark: A fast and general-purpose cluster computing system that can handle batch and real-time data processing.
            Hive: Provides a SQL-like interface to query data stored in Hadoop, making it easier for analysts to work with big data.
            
     Cloud-Based Platforms:            
            Amazon Web Services (AWS): Offers a wide range of data analytics services, including data storage, processing, and machine learning.
            Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Provides tools for data storage, processing, machine learning, and big data analysis.
            Microsoft Azure: Offers a comprehensive suite of cloud services, including data analytics, machine learning, and data warehousing.
   

“An algorithm is essentially a set of step-by-step instructions or rules to solve a specific problem or complete a task. Think of it like a recipe for a computer. It tells the computer exactly what to do and in what order to achieve a desired outcome.”
